# Project of the year

A board game for programmers

*The project manager has quit.
The heavy responsibility falls on you to deliver "the project of the year".
The top management is counting on _you_,
because, frankly, they got nobody else to get this done.*

Try to not reveal these details to the players, let them discover on their own, through playing.

(=) Alternative back story, not used for this game.

*Your time has finally come. You have found the genius idea you were looking for all your life.
You quit your job to have the time to make it happen, and you have the funding to do it.
You start alone, so no politics and project managers can get in your way this time.
This time, everything will be different. This time, you can do it right.*

## Game overview

Players (ideally played by programmers) take on the (reluctant) role of managers.
Their goal is to build "the project of the year" before another competitor does it,
or before the 12 rounds run out (= months).

To make this happen, you will need to gather a team of programmers and deliver features,
while battling with technical debt, accumulating bugs, and pointy haired bosses.

(=) *"No need to explain more at this point, you know how this all works!"*

---

(=) Many details of the game should not be explained to the players,
but left up for discovery. For example, what exactly is "the project of the year",
and what exactly it means that "it is built", are intentionally undefined.
This is an ironic reference to reality, and the game tries to pack as many of those as possible.

## Components

A. Programmers. Each player starts with one "epic" programmer.
   The player represents the programmer.
   During the game more programmers can be recruited from the audience.

B. Interns. Interns are also recruited from the audience.

## Setup

### Receive starting elements

Each player chooses a starting programmer and a target product to build.

Programmer archetypes:

- Neckbeard
- FGITW (fastest gun in the west)
- ...

(=) This "choice" is just for fun. All archetypes are the same.
*They are all highly productive but dirty programmers*,
designed to cause more problems than they solve.

Target products: (WIP)

- ...
- TODO: see Code Complete section 3.2 for product type ideas

(=) Again, the target product "choice" can be just for fun, for now.
Find choices that make programmers smile.
Later they could affect the gameplay.

The programmer starts with 5 productivity tokens and no skills.
